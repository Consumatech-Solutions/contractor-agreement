* General availability, (national) holidays, parental leave, planned or likely medical absences and planned or likely vacation days need to be communicated in the project kick-off. That means that the developer and the partner-lead need to jointly prepare a list of all those events before the project kick-off. In the weekly status meetings the developer needs to ensure to communicate any updates regarding these events. Failure to communicate updates about these events can have severe consequences for the relationship to the client. Therefore it is important that this obligation for updates is taken very seriously
* Emergencies like funerals, unplanned child-care, or sickness need to be reported on the same day

* Working on other projects is only permissible with explicit permission by Consumatech tech-lead
