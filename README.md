That means that the developer and the partner-lead need to jointly prepare a list of all those events before the project kick-off. In the weekly status meetings the developer needs to ensure to communicate any updates regarding these events. Failure to communicate updates about these events can have severe consequences for the relationship to the client. Therefore it is important that this obligation for updates is taken very seriously
